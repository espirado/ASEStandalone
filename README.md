# `ASEStandalone`
A standalone version of ASE analysis pipeline from `molgenis`.

## About the standalone version
All of the code are copied from the `systemsgenetics` repository in `molgenis`
organization. Some necessarily trivial modification was done by 
[Zhenhua Zhang](https://github.com/zhenhua-zhang) to achieve a runnable
distribution. A simple build with dependencies, most of which are in `jar`, was
done by `Gradle` (Version 5.2.1, `OpenJDK` 1.8.0_181) on `Debian` (`stretch`,
release 9.7) to get a distribution version.
