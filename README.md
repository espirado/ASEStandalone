# `ASEStandalone`
A standalone version of ASE analysis pipeline from `molgenis`. 

## About the standalone version
All of the code are copied from the `systemsgenetics` repository in `molgenis`
organization. A simple build with dependencies most of which are in `jar` was
done by `Gradle`(Version 5.2.1) on Debian(stretch, release 9.7) to get a
distribution version.
